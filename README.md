## KeepTrack website project
This Project's purpose is to provide users with an easy to use website to help them manage and 'keep track' of anything they desire.

Users can create an account with an email and number. As soon as your account is created, an email is sent to welcome the user.

Users can create reminders, which will either email or text the user when the time they specify comes.

Users can also create different projects, which can help them organize the tables they create through different projects/category
